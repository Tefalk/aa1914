# aa1914+
Implementations of axis and allies applications for 1914 and 1941. I am also using this repository to develop my vacation map.

One of the benefits of using the browser as a basis for this application is the availability of an excellent map from Sir_Cala via the axis and allies website. It is easy to navigate to all of the boundaries. I also found maps for axis and allies 1941 plus Anniversary addition.

As of 09/26/18 with sketch3 and travel3 all the problems associated with the location of cities (against a pink background) and printing the name and date have been resolved.

My next change (in the near future) will be to add the ship name to the print data.

I think I will make a major change in direction to get to the aa1914 solution in that I will put a spreadsheet like grid over the map and then associate those cells with aa land territories and zones.
